# TODO
# replace env.sh with locally stored env.sh (we do not want to include it in git, yes gitignore works but cannot trust anyone that edits it)
# zip ../production and scp it to server using locally stored ssh keys
# unzip in server
# chmod startup.sh
# run startup.sh
# add startup.sh to cron
# delete the zip
